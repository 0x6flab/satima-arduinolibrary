# DRV8870 Motor Driver Library for Arduino

This library allows you to control unipolar or bipolar DC motors. To use it you will need a DC motor, and the appropriate hardware to control it, which is the DRV8870 motor driver.

With this DC motor driver, satima motor driver adopts DRV8870 chips that performs excellent in low power consumption application. It is also able to worked at high current and high voltage compared to the L293 motor driver. The motor driver can provide 3.6A output current at 15V. Besides, the motor drive supports 6~15V wide-range power input.
